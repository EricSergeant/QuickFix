## Wins
``Learning a new technology -- TypeScript!``

- Independently learning TypeScript through Scrimba tutorials, YouTube videos, documentation, and each other's insight was both rewarding and joyful. 

``Overcoming Surprising Challeneges``

- The original intention of this application shifted gears when our initial food-based API went down. Because the goal of this project was to learn TypeScript and not necessarily to make a food themed application, we regrouped quickly, found a working book related API, and carried on. Our group handled this shift with a great deal of empathy and democracy all while maintaing the deadline.

## Challenges and Improvements
``Timeline``

- Learning and implementing TypeScript in a quick 10 day sprint was challenging. TypeScript is loud and invasive, so unpacking the errors with a rapidly approaching deadline served to be quite difficult at times.

``Inconsistent Data from the APIs``

- This application uses a free and public API that provides inconsistent data. This lead to interesting error handling and conditionals to account for all of the different data shapes being sent back to the application in network requests.
